## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

To run this project from scratch I created multiple coding/mark up languages files on my repository. They are index.html, script.js and styles.css. Files I have added are Nasm_Assembly_Project and Resume_of_Erick Rayas_.pdf. The various .png files are to showcase the images on each tab of the website. I first coded the index.html to get the framework of the website along with coding the script.js, which is the JavaScript programming language that enabled functionality such as the animation and tab organization. The styles.css allowed me to stylize the website to make it light blue and other colors of the pages. Through all this I was able to create each tab for the project with all functions and animations in a neat and organized manner to ensure the portfolio website works on mobile devices as well. Here is the finished project website: https://erickrayas1358.github.io/erickrayas1358/
