    Greetings, my name is Erick Rayas. I am a junior here at California State University, Fullerton. I am majoring in computer science. I was born in Van Nuys California in the Los Angeles County within the San Fernando Valley. I was raised in the city of North Hills. I enjoy gaming, bowling, computing, exercising, playing with my pets, going out, and exploring new things. I plan to increase my knowledge and expertise beyond my degree as I plan on participating on extra curriculars on this wonderful university campus for what it has to offer. Thank you for visiting my page and I look forward getting to know you.
